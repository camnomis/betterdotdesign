## What Iâ€™m doing now?

Ater working for myself as a freelance consultant, I have taken a permeant role as Head of Profession for Service Design with HM Revenue & Customs.

I am still finding my feet in the role but I am focused on three main areas

1. Building the service design community with HMRC.
2. Big programme consultancy into the programmes, user experience of the tax system, how do we influence that.
3. Advocate for service design to the whole organisation. There are pockets of really good design and areas where design is still in its infancy, I want to share the successes and good work with new audiances

## Short term goals



## Medium term goals
## Long term goals

1. Be able to run five kilometres again (by the end of 2022).
2. Blog regularly (twice per month would be ideal).
3. 2 hours every six weeks user research

## Books I am reading
