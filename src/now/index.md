## What Iâ€™m doing now?

Until 2022 I was working for myself as a freelance consultant. In October took a permeant role as Head of Profession for Service Design with HM Revenue & Customs.

I am still finding my feet in the role but I am focused on three main areas

1. Building the service design community with HMRC. There are a lot of service designers working across the department. I am looking to bring them together as a community to share good practice and support each other.

2. Support the delivery of service design within the Chief Technology & Design Office. This includes areas such as the Policy Lab, UCD Impacting and other areas of pre-discovery and exploration.

3. Advocate for service design to the whole organisation. There are pockets of good design and areas where design is still in its infancy, I want to share the successes and good work with new audiences.

## Short term goals
1. Be able to regularly run five kilometres again by the end of 2022 ([See how I am doing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-GB-NvmneyGMMdGRvW6n7-IpRAslK12J4mm8NvQQrc0/edit#gid=1948449458))
2. Blog regularly (twice per month would be ideal).
3. 2 hours every six weeks user research

## Medium term goals

TBD!

## Long term goals

TBD!
